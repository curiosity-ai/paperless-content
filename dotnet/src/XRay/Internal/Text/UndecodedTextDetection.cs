/// <para>
/// The glyphs on such a page draw correctly and the character codes come out as ordinary Latin
/// letters, so nothing in the pipeline fails and nothing downstream can tell the difference: the
/// text is well-formed, indexable, and wrong. It reaches the index as thousands of words that
/// match no query and dilute every ranking, which is worse than extracting nothing at all — hence
/// a flag rather than a silent pass.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Two failure shapes, and they need different tests. A wrong CMap that is a <em>permutation</em>
/// of the alphabet (a font subset whose codes are offset — "Nachhaltige" drawn as
/// "1DFKKDOWLJH") keeps a normal letter-frequency profile, so only the vowel structure gives it
/// away. A CMap that <em>collapses</em> many codes onto one character ("Agaaaaa: AAAA AabaaAA")
/// keeps plausible vowels but destroys the frequency profile. Either alone misses half the cases.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Thresholds are set from the measured distribution over the project's 475-file corpus, not
/// from the two files that motivated the check, and each sits clear of the most extreme
/// legitimate document in that corpus: sheet music with hyphen-split lyrics reaches a 0.312
/// top-letter share and 3.83 bits, and a base64 attachment dump reaches a 0.245 vowel ratio with
/// 20% of its letters in long consonant runs. Nothing legitimate came within reach of both halves
/// of either rule.
