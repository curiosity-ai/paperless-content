/// <b>The chunking half is not ported.</b> It is tree-sitter's, and tree-sitter is a C library

/// What that costs is bounded and measurable: under the default configuration
/// <c>tslp::process</c> returns no chunks — every one of the corpus's eighteen source fixtures
/// has <c>chunks: []</c> and <c>data: null</c> in the goldens generated with the feature on —
/// so the verbatim path is the whole of the observed behaviour, and it is what this reproduces.
/// A caller who turns chunking on upstream gets headings and per-chunk code elements that this
