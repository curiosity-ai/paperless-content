/// This is the one part of OCR that needs a second native dependency: PDFium, through
/// <c>PaddleOCR.Pdf</c>. The port's own PDF reader extracts text and geometry but does not
/// rasterise, and a scanned page's text exists only as pixels — so without a rasteriser
/// <see cref="OcrMode.ScanOnly"/> could not work at all. See "Deviation: optional OCR" in
/// <c>dotnet/Claude.md</c> for why that trade-off was taken.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Pages come back PNG-encoded rather than as the library's own image type, which costs an
/// encode here and a decode in the recognizer. That is deliberate: it keeps
/// <see cref="IOcrEngine"/> free of PaddleOCR types, so the surrounding flow stays testable
/// without the package's models. Recognition costs orders of magnitude more than the round trip.
