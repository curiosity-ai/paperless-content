//! Regression test: JBIG2-compressed scanner PDFs must render non-blank.
//!
//! Scanners emitting Mixed Raster Content put a page's entire text layer in JBIG2
//! `/ImageMask`s. The mask path handled CCITT only and then required packed 1-bit rows,
//! so a compressed JBIG2 bitstream failed the length check, the error was swallowed, and
//! the page still rendered `Ok` — just without ink. Pages then OCR'd to nothing.
//!
//! The always-on coverage for the fix is the packing unit tests in
//! `src/extractors/images.rs` (`image_mask_packing_tests`) and the codec-detection tests
//! in `src/rendering/page_renderer.rs`. This file adds a render-level assertion against a
//! real scanner PDF, which cannot be vendored here — see the constant below.
